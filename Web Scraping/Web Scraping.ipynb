    "# Web Scraping in Python\n",
    "\n",
    " In this appendix lecture we'll go over how to scrape information from the web using Python. \n",
    " \n",
    " ##### We'll go to a website, decide what information we want, see where and how it is stored, then scrape it and set it as a pandas DataFrame!\n",
    " \n",
    " #### Some things you should consider before web scraping a website:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1.) You should check a site's terms and conditions before you scrape them. \n",
    " \n",
    " 2.) Space out your requests so you don't overload the site's server, doing this could get you blocked.\n",
    " \n",
    " 3.) Scrapers break after time - web pages change their layout all the time, you'll more than likely have to rewrite your code. \n",
    " \n",
    " 4.) Web pages are usually inconsistent, more than likely you'll have to clean up the data after scraping it.\n",
    " \n",
    " 5.) Every web page and situation is different, you'll have to spend time configuring your scraper.\n",
    " \n",
    " #### To learn more about HTML I suggest theses two resources:\n",
    " \n",
    " [W3School](http://www.w3schools.com/html/)\n",
    " \n",
    " [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web)\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " #### There are three modules we'll need in addition to python are:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1.) BeautifulSoup, which you can download by typing: *pip install beautifulsoup4* or *conda install beautifulsoup4* (for the Anaconda distrbution of Python) in your command prompt.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2.) lxml , which you can download by typing: *pip install lxml* or *conda install lxml* (for the Anaconda distrbution of Python) in your command prompt.\n",
    " \n",
    " 3.) requests,  which you can download by typing: *pip install requests* or *conda install requests* (for the Anaconda distrbution of Python) in your command prompt."
